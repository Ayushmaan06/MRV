st.write("""
    **Multi-Modal RAG** stands for **Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. It's a process that allows you to ask questions about different types of media, such as  images, or documents, and get answers powered by artificial intelligence.
    
    In this app, you can interact with the following features:
    
    1. **Image Question Answering**: Upload an image, and the app will describe it. You can ask questions about the contents of the image.
    2. **Document Question Answering**: Upload a document (PDF, Word, etc.), and the app will extract the relevant information to answer your questions.
    
    Here's how it works:

    - **Image QA**: Upload an image, and the app will analyze the image, describing its contents. You can then ask questions about whatâ€™s in the image.
    
    - **Document QA**: Upload a document (like a PDF or Word file). The app extracts key information from the document to help answer your questions.
    
    Each feature uses a combination of AI models and sophisticated algorithms to give you the best possible answers.
